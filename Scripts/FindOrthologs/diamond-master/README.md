Introduction
============

DIAMOND is a sequence aligner for protein and translated DNA searches,
designed for high performance analysis of big sequence data. The key
features are:

-   Pairwise alignment of proteins and translated DNA at 100x-10,000x
    speed of BLAST.
-   Frameshift alignments for long read analysis.
-   Low resource requirements and suitable for running on standard
    desktops or laptops.
-   Various output formats, including BLAST pairwise, tabular and XML,
    as well as taxonomic classification.
